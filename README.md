Information about Orchestra
Orchestra by definition is an open source Robotic Process Automation system that organizes teams of human experts and machines to work together. Even though the definition claims it is an RPA system, I don't think the project Hemil has created so far is defined as one. It could potenially be automated, but we haven't gotten to that yet. 

The new version of Orchestra can be used to automate back-office tasks, professional service workflows, and complex analytical work.

StaffBot: Used to automatically find workers for a task or reaches out to qualified workers and offers them a task. They use slack or email to allow workers to either accept or reject the task. It is also knows which workers are avilable so that the process is quicker and more time efficient. 

SanityBot: Checks the status of projects and alters the team if something seems off. It is running sanity checks every few minutes to determine which tasks are on or off track. If a team member has been out of the office for a few days or a project is close to it's deadline, SanityBot will alert team members through slack letting them know the project condtions have not been met. 

1. This is a very useful setting to have when working with agile teams. You are able to track the project while completing it and come across any problems you might have through increments. If a team member is going to be out for a while and you are going to have a periodic check with your client soon, other team members can divide up their work to make sure you meet your checkpoint for your client. That way if there is a problem or you don't know how your client would like something done you can talk to them sooner than later. 

Nested self-pruning checklists: Core experts can submit a task once their work is done. The completed task is sent to an available expert reviewer. Expert reviewers can either accept the task for further review or complete, or they can reject the task and give feedback and request changes. This is where Hemil is at now with the project. 

Experts can use checklists to properly complete the project. Reviewers can leave feedback on certain checklist items to reinforce important guidelines, and the checklist reminds experts of feedback they received on future projects. 

Time Tracking: This records how long it takes a person or machine to complete a task. Orchestra has a timer that experts can turn on when they begin working on a task and then off when they finsih. This allows them to see how much time was spent working on a specific task. Once the timer starts the expert can also add a description of the task they worked on. 

Orchestra is the only open source example of Robotic Process Automation on the market. Orchestra shows the benefits of RPA through: 
1. Increased accuracy and consistency
2. Less time spent coordinating projects
3. Fewer dollars spent on identifying experts to staff projects
4. Improved reporting and compliance
